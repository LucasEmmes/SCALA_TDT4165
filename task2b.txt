What is this phenomenon called? Give one example of a situation where it can be
problematic.

This is called non-determinism.

Let's take the bank example. We have two threads.

Thread 1 will read your current balance and then remove 2$

Thread 2 will read your current balance and then add 3$

All in all these two threads equals to four operations.

t1: read balance
t1: write balance - 2
t2: read balance
t2: write balance + 3

Leaving you with a balance of +1$

Since the order of operations is nondeterministisc we don't know which order they come in.

In a worst case senario they could end up in this order:

t1: read balance
t2: read balance
t2: write balance + 3
t1: write balance - 2

This would leave you with a balance of -2 instead of +1 which would be bad.
